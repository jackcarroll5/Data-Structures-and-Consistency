1.The HashSet would go through the Dictionary in a faster amount of time than the TreeSet because the isWord() method in the HashSet contains a hashCode() method that will enable this set to search for the elements
easily through the use of bucket searching. Also, the HashSet contains a HashMap that will get the HashSet to retrieve the words in the dictionary very quickly. The TreeSet will get all the words in the dictionary
more slowly than the HashSet as the logarithmic notation of the input size, ((log2n) - 2 squared) will work in conjunction with the algorithm's runtime which is quick but not as fast as the HashSet, e.g 1278 ms.
 The HashSet would complete the method to get all the words in the dictionary in a quick amount of time, e.g 625 ms because the HashSet contains() method with the O(1) notation will not require the input's size
 as this data structure will have constant time where the HashSet has faster retrieval of words than the TreesEt.
